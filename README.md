# LaJSON - Light Alternative JSON Library for Java
<center>
LaJSON aims to provide an alternative library to parse JSON formatted data, with direct and unambigious mapping to JSON input or output.
</center>
<h3>Design goals</h3>
<p>-At least as fast or faster than JSON.org</p>
<p>-Small (an under 20 kbyte addition)</p>
<p>-Usable in most Java environments</p>
<p>-Unambigious serialization to JSON and back into LaJSON objects. (input for numbers should match output, even for cases where it will not be so for json.org.</p>
<p>-No additional dependencies to other libraries</p>
<p>-Obfuscation friendly</p>
<p>-<bold>Practicality</bold></p>
