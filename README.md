# LaJSON - Light Alternative JSON Library for Java
<center>
LaJSON aims to provide an alternative library to parse and create JSON formatted data, with direct and unambigious mapping to JSON input or output.
</center>
<h3>Project goals</h3>
<p>-At least as fast or faster than JSON.org, At least as fast or faster as GSON JSONParser, focused on bigger input and outputs</p>
<p>-Small (an under 20 kbyte addition)</p>
<p>-Usable in most Java environments</p>
<p>-Unambigious serialization to JSON and back into LaJSON objects. (input for numbers should match output, even for cases where it will not be so for json.org.</p>
<p>-No additional dependencies to other libraries</p>
<p>-Obfuscation friendly (no need to configure proguard etc) </p>
<p>-<bold>Practicality</bold></p>

# Usage

see <a href=https://github.com/lassikin/LaJSON/blob/master/manual.md> manual. </a>

# Reached goals
With larger inputs, faster than either json or gson.

# Installation / Requirements of the runtime system

Add the .jar library into your project. Alternatively you can simply just add the .java into your project(it's a single file, which is part of the project goals, 1 java file - WITH NO EXTRA DEPENDENCIES)


Maven and Gradle packages coming in the future
