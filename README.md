# LaJSON - Light Alternative JSON Library for Java

LaJSON aims to provide an alternative library to json.org, with direct and unambigious mapping to json input or output.

design goals:
<ul>
<il>at least as fast or faster than json.org</il>
<il>*definitive mapping to json and back</il>
<il>*intuitively know what the output and input will be</il>
<il>*not lose data in de-serialization or serialization</il>
<il>*done on the limitations of JSON</il>
<il>*relatively small code addition</il>
<il>*runnable on most Java based systems</il>
</ul>
